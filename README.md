# getrss
Console commands to get RSS feeds from any website.

Open your browser to any web page.
Use F12 button, or right click and inspect the webpage code. 
Navigate to the console section.
Copy and paste the commands.
There will be a new document named 'rss_feeds.opml'.
You can then edit the file or import the feeds into your favorite RSS feed reader.

I hope this helps someone else.
